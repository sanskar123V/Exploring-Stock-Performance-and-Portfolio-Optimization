# Exploring-Stock-Performance-and-Portfolio-Optimization

In this article, we delve into stock performance analysis and portfolio optimization using data from four prominent technology companies: AMD, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, and ORACLE. By leveraging Python libraries, we download and analyze historical stock data, performing various analyses such as visualization, moving averages, trading volume, daily returns, and portfolio optimization.

### Data Acquisition and Visualization

We begin by acquiring one year's worth of historical stock data. This data includes key attributes such as adjusted close prices and trading volumes. Through visualizations, we examine the stock price trends over time, revealing insights into their performance and volatility.

### Moving Averages and Trading Volume

To gain a deeper understanding, we calculate and plot the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for each stock. These moving averages help identify trends and potential buy/sell signals. Additionally, we analyze the trading volume to assess market activity and liquidity.

### Daily Returns and Correlation Analysis

We compute the daily returns for each stock to measure their day-to-day performance. By plotting the distribution of these returns, we gain insights into their volatility and risk. A correlation matrix further highlights the relationships between the stocks, revealing how they move in relation to each other.

### Portfolio Optimization

Finally, we perform portfolio optimization to identify the optimal combination of stocks that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. By simulating multiple portfolios and calculating their expected returns and volatility, we visualize the efficient frontier and determine the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating the best risk-adjusted return.

### Conclusion

Through this analysis, we gain valuable insights into the performance and risk profiles of AMD, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, and ORACLE stocks. The portfolio optimization process provides a strategic approach to investment, highlighting the importance of diversification and risk management in achieving optimal returns.
